# GHotKeys

## What is GHotKeys?

This is a small tray app that allows you to register key combination with a custom action. 

Currently it is limited to assigning virtual Media and Volume Keys (PlayPause, Stop, Previous/Next Track, Volume Up/Down/Mute) as it was the main purpose of this small project.
For more advanced hotkey app I recommend looking at [AutoHotkey project](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) or https://autohotkey.com/

## How to use it?

Click *Register new*  to register new combination. At least one modifier has to be selected in order to register global hotkey. If combination cannot be registered you will be informed about that, otherwise hotkey becomes active as long as the app is running.

By clicking *Show Hotkeys* you can see all registered hotkeys and remove them as well. You can assign as many hotkeys as you like to the same functions.

You can add the program to Startup to automatically open it when Windows starts... up :)
